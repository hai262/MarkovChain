# ðŸ”— Markov Chain Modeling

## Project Overview
The Markov Chain Modeling project demonstrates the use of probabilistic models to analyze and predict sequences of events. By leveraging Markov chains, this project explores state transitions and sequence predictions, providing valuable insights into dynamic systems and processes.

## Key Features
- **Sequence Prediction:** Utilizes Markov chain models to predict future states based on historical sequence data.
- **State Transition Analysis:** Analyzes the probability of transitioning between different states, which can be applied in various domains such as customer behavior, web navigation, and more.
- **Data Visualization:** Provides interactive visualizations to illustrate state probabilities and transition matrices.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Allows users to adjust model parameters to fit different datasets and scenarios.
- **Interactive Demonstration:** A Streamlit-based dashboard for real-time experimentation with Markov chain models.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Modeling:** Custom Python code for Markov chain calculations
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Web Interface:** Streamlit
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
